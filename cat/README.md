# cat

Write a program called cat that takes a filename as input and writes the
content to os.Stdout.

Bonus: do it without buffering the file contents in memory.

Bonus: add a command line flag to change the output to os.Stderr. Hint: see
package flag.

Bonus: add a command line flag to optionally print the size of the file at the
end of the output.
